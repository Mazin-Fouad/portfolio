          I've always been fascinated by the various ways code can be used to
          create unique and purposeful things. Software development combines my
          strengths and interests in this field. I joined the "Developer
          Akademie" in Munich to learn programming and acquire the necessary
          skills in web development. The academy provided a professional roadmap
          with well-studied projects to acquire the necessary skills in the
          world of Programming.
